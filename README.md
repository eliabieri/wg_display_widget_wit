# WG Display Widget Interface

The WebAssembly WIT interface for [WG Display](https://github.com/eliabieri/wg_display) widgets.  
This interface is implemented by the host (the WG Display application) as well as the widgets (WebAssembly components).  
See [wg_display_widget_rs](https://github.com/eliabieri/wg_display_widget_rs) for a template on how to implement a widget in Rust.
